# Tetris RayLib

I managed to make this within 24 hours, after most of a year spent
"intending" to do it.  The behaviour is largely modelled on the
GameBoy version of the game, with the small addition of primitive
horizontal wall kicks (so you can still rotate a piece against a
wall).

The repository name says SDL because that's what I wrote it in
initially.  I spent a further 2-3 hours porting it to RayLib, so you
should be able to just compile and run it on Windows or Linux, after
downloading the submodule(s).
