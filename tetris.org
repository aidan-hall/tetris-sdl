#+title: Tetris Design Document
* Terminology
Consistent use of terminology will be beneficial.
** Tile/Block/Square
These make up the play field and [[*Piece][pieces]].
** Piece
The falling thing that the player controls.  These are one-sided
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino][polyominoes]].  In Tetris, they are strictly tetrominoes.
* TODO Overview Design [0%]
** Copying 
See https://tetris.com/play-tetris/, especially the "General Gameplay
Info" in the "How to Play" menu:
[[file:general-gameplay-info.png]]
** Interaction 
A series of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino#One-sided_tetrominoes][one-sided tetrominoes]] fall down onto a play field. The
player can move them side-to-side, and rotate them, to fit them into
the pattern of the pieces already played.  They can also make the
pieces move down more quickly.

The player has a preview of (the) upcoming piece(s), and may be able
to "hold" a piece, which they can then swap with the next/currently
falling one.
** Goal 
If a complete row is filled with tiles, it disappears, and all the
rows above it move down.  Multiple rows can be cleared at the same
time.
** TODO Lose Condition 
If a piece intersects a square when it is spawned, it is game over.
** TODO Scoring 
The player scores points depending on how many rows are cleared in one
go, as well as other factors?  After scoring a sufficient number of
points, the level increases by 1, which causes the pieces to fall
faster.

This is the scoring system on https://tetris.com/play-tetris
| Action                     |                    Score |
|----------------------------+--------------------------|
| Soft Drop                  | 1×Distance (whilst held) |
| Hard Drop                  |               2×Distance |
| Single Line Clear          |                      100 |
| Double Line Clear          |                      300 |
| Triple Line Clear          |                      500 |
| Quadruple Line Clear       |                      800 |
| T-Spin([[*T-Spin]])            |                      400 |
| T-Spin Single (line clear) |                      800 |
| T-Spin Double (line clear) |                     1200 |
| T-Spin Triple (line clear) |                     1600 |
| Back-to-Back               |     0.5×Tetris or T-Spin |
* Pieces
There are seven distinct one-sided [[*Interaction][tetrominoes]]: I, O, T, J, L, S, Z.
* Controls
** Horizontal Movement
- Straightforward; can only move if there is space in the given
  direction.
** Rotation
*** SRS
Super/Standard/Smooth Rotation System
- https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/SRS
- This is notable for specifying how [[*Kicks][kicks]] should behave.
- It apparently creates interest in multiplayer, but causes problems
  in single-player.
*** Nintendo Rotation System
https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_Rotation_System
- Similarly to horizontal movement, there must be space for the piece
  in the next rotated orientation, although the rotation doesn't have
  to make sense physically (see [[*T-Spin]]). 
- A piece can either rotate about a single square (T, J, L, S, Z), or
  a "corner" between squares (I, O) (this was made more obvious by the
  [[*Pentris][Pentris]] zero-gravity mode.
- The T, J, & L pieces all have 4 orientations, I, S & Z have 2 and O
  has 1.
*** Bastet
Seems to use 4 states for every piece (probably including O) for
simplicity.  The odd behaviour of the I piece under this scheme
** Lock Delay
https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Lock_delay
** Kicks
Basically, when a rotation is attempted, the piece is moved into a
position where that orientation is possible.
** Drop
Pieces normally fall by themselves over time.
- Soft :: Increase the falling speed while held.
- Hard :: Immediately move the piece down to land directly below where
  it is now.  Awkward to use without a [[*Piece Ghost][piece ghost]].
* Advanced Techniques
** T-Spin
A T piece can be rotated to fill a gap underneath other tiles, which
would otherwise be inaccessible.  Performing a T-Spin can lead to
being awarded bonus points, especially if its placement clears lines
(see [[*Scoring]]).

* Piece Selection
** Random
Approved by Burgun2013.
** N-Bag
Shuffle a list of the possible pieces, then use that for the order to
deliver them in.  Once all of the pieces in the current N-Bag have
been seen, generate the next one.
** Evil Tetris
The only factor the computer agent can control is what piece is
selected, so this is what is used to implement 
*** [[http://fph.altervista.org/prog/bastet.html][Bastet]] (Bastard Tetris)
A ncurses-based clone that picks the "worst possible [piece]".
*** [[https://medium.com/@amoghhgoma/beatris-an-evil-tetris-ai-88fee6b068][Beatris]]
An adversarial network.
* Implementations and Variants
** Official Tetris Website
https://tetris.com/play-tetris
** Pentris
https://www.pentris.net/v3/
- Rather than being restricted to tetrominoes, pieces with anywhere
  between 1 and 5 tiles can be played.
- This version has a "zero gravity" mode, where pieces only fall when
  the player presses the drop buttons.
** GameBoy
- Doesn't implement the [[*SRS][Standard Rotation System]], etc., making it
  harder.
- Random pieces, only 1 (toggleable) piece preview.
** Type B
Start with a few incomplete rows before the game begins.
* Assistance Features
** Modern vs Classic Tetris
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCQFauk80gE][Arguments against Modern Tetris Tier List]] (focus on Vs Tetris).
- Burgun2013, p. xi.
** Piece Ghost
Shows a preview of where a piece would land if it dropped from its
present position without being moved or rotated.
